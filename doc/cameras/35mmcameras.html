<B>Welcome to my home page.</b>

<BR>

Here you will find pictures and information on part of my camera collection.  Be patient
as I am not yet done with it.  The cameras are all most old used manual SLRs and Rangefinders.

	The Russian Rangefinders are loosely based on the Leica IIc.  The early models (Zorki I and FED I) are
	almost identical.  So much so, Fake Leicas abound based on these early models.  The Zenits are Zorkis
	with a Reflex mirror added.  Doing so, the lense registration had to be increase from 28.8mm to 46.46mm.
	This is the same as the Pentax and Practika cameras.  However the early Zenits used a 39mm mount just
	as the Zorkis.  Shown below is the Zorki 6 on the left and the Zenit 3M on right.

     <LI>Lenses:<br>
	I have many lenses. Of interest would be the Industar 50 50mm/F3.5 lenses on the Zenit 3M and Zorkis.
	The Zorkis have an extension ring to make up the difference in lense registration distance.  Also 
	unique is the C.Z. Jena 80mm East German lense, Zenitar 16mm Fisheye and Tair 3 Photosniper lense.
