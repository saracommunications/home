Pentax Cable Switch CS-205 for the *istD and other cameras.

Matt in Britain said this about a CS-205 switch

Managed to buy a CS-205 shutter release for my *istD. For those electronic savvy out there, here's the pin out:


      2.5mm stereo plug (like a smaller headphone plug)
      Sleeve - Common
      Ring - Focus
      Tip - Shutter


Like all remotes the focus shorts to common before the shutter does. It also includes a lock facility which leaves both Focus and Shutter connected to Common.



Have fun at Radio Shack.
Max.
